                <p style="word-break: break-all;">When six former public servants and scholars of unique distinction conjointly author a book on China,

                <h2 style="margin: 0;">Novak Djokovic had COVID-19 a month ago</h2>
                <p style="word-break: break-all;">Tennis world number one Novak Djokovic contracted COVID-19 last month but was not experiencing 
                    symptoms and had written clearance from Australia’s immigration department before travelling to the country with a medical 
                    exemption from its vaccination rules, his lawyers said in a court filing on Saturday.
                    Djokovic, who is in immigration detention in Australia after having his visa cancelled on arrival on Thursday, returned his 
                    first positive coronavirus test on Dec. 16, 2021, but 14 days later “had not had a fever or respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 in 
                    the last 72 hours”, the filing said.
